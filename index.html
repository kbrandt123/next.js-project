        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for
          React applications. It was created by Vercel (formerly Zeit) and is frequently updated, with the latest major
          version (v13) being released in October 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next.js is associated with Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions. The company's
          goal in creating Next.js was to make it easier to build high-performance, SEO-friendly React applications with
          features like automatic code splitting, client-side routing, and built-in support for server-side rendering.
        </p>
        <p>
          The primary selling points of Next.js are its improved developer experience, enhanced performance, and better
          SEO compared to a traditional React application. It also provides a more opinionated and a "batteries-included"
          approach, which can be beneficial for developers who want to focus on building their application rather than
          setting up a complex development environment.

        <h2>Learn</h2>
        <p>
          To get started with Next.js, you can check out the official <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs"
            target="_blank">documentation</a>, which provides a comprehensive guide on how to set up and use the
          framework. Additionally, here are three recent free tutorials that can help you learn Next.js:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__mSgDEOyv8" target="_blank">Next.js Basics
              </a> - This is a short 10 minute tutorial on a brief introduction to the framework. It is done by one of my favorite developers to watch named FireShip. He is most well known for his short snippets of doing code-reports, discussing the latest and hottest topics in technology.  </li>
          <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVnjOPwW4ZA" target="_blank">Next.js one hour tutorial</a>
          - This is a more in-depth tutorial which will show you how to install Next.js, along with routing and navigation, client and server components, and more. Watching this turotial will give you a good idea about how to start using Next.js on your own, however do not expect to be an expert in just on hour. </li>
          <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZJJ189JTks&t=16s" target="_blank">Next.js five hour tutorial</a> - The last tutorial is also by a YouTuber that I admire and his name is Dorian Develops. He is popular for giving advice, especailly for self-taught developers. In this tutorial, he walks you through the tutorial that Next.js provides on their website. Here you will learn how to setup a database, handling errors, adding authentication and more. By completing this tutorial, you would develop a strongt understanding of the Next.js framework.  </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Community</h2>
        <p>
          The Next.js community is very active and supportive, with a dedicated <a
            href="https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started#community" target="_blank">community page</a> on the official
          website. The community provides resources such as a Discord server, a subreddit, and a list of
          community-maintained libraries and tools. The best Next.js community is the <a
            href='https://www.reddit.com/r/nextjs/' target="_blank">Next.js reddit page.</a> This is an incredibly active community where you can talk about your work or ask any questions. Community members post here daily. 
      
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, the <a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js" target="_blank">Next.js GitHub repository</a> is
          a great place to discuss issues, ask questions, and contribute to the project.

        <h2>Examples</h2>
        <p>
          Next.js is used by many popular websites and applications, including <a href="https://www.vercel.com" target="_blank" 
            target="_blank">Vercel</a>, <a href="https://www.netflix.com/" target="_blank">Netflix</a>, and <a
            href="https://www.twitch.tv/" target="_blank">Twitch</a>. These websites showcase the versatility and power
          of Next.js, with features like static site generation, dynamic imports, and API routes. I actually used this framework on my largest project where I built a League of Legends Survey. I chose to use Next.js because of its ability to have your front-end and back-end in one application. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, I believe Next.js is a great choice for web development, as it provides a robust and opinionated
          framework that can help streamline the development process and improve the performance and SEO of your React
          applications.
